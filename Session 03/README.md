# Business Intelligence and Data Warehouse Course

## Session 3

The topic of this session is **Data Modelling**. This repository includes the content discussed in class:

  - Concepts
  - Exercises
  - FAQ
  - References

## Main concepts

  - **Star Schema**: A single large central fact table (business process to analyze) and one table for each dimension (business perspective of analysis).
  - **Snowflake Schema**: Variant of star schema model. It consist in a single, large and central fact table and one or more tables for each dimension. Dimension tables are normalized split dimension table data into additional tables
  - **Fact Constellation**: Multiple fact tables share dimension tables. This schema is viewed as collection of stars hence.
  - **Data Vault**: novel approach for data modelling. It be understood as a hybrid approach encompassing the best of breed between 3NF and Star Schemas. It is based on hubs (business concepts), links (relations between hubs) and satellites (attributes for links and hubs). 
 
## How to use this content

## FAQ

### Which is the meaning of MySQL Workbench flags? 

When creating attibutes with MSQL Workbench we can use different flags:

  - PK: Primary Key
  - NN: Not Null
  - BIN: Binary (stores data as binary strings. There is no character set so sorting and comparison is based on the numeric values of the bytes in the values.)
  - UN: Unsigned (non-negative numbers only. so if the range is -500 to 500, instead its 0 - 1000, the range is the same but it starts at 0)
  - UQ: Create/remove Unique Key
  - ZF: Zero-Filled (if the length is 5 like INT(5) then every field is filled with 0â€™s to the 5th value. 12 = 00012, 400 = 00400, etc. )
  - AI: Auto Increment
  - G: Generated column. i.e. value generated by a formula based on the other columns.

### Can we use an iterative/incremental development for the dw?

Yes. We can use user story as work unit to begin building and evolving the DW/BI system. For example, let's assume you have the following user story:
 
> **As** a Marketing Analyst
> **I need** the ability to see the marketing budget per year
> **In order to identify** the evolution of marketing budget

From this user story we can identify one dimension (date) and one fact table (budget). Let's assume now a new user story:

> **As** a Marketing Analyst
> **I need** the ability to see the marketing budget per campaign
> **In order to identify** the distribution of marketing budget per campaign

From this second story it is clear that we need to add a new dimension to our model (campaign).

Most of the times, we refer iterative/incremental development as [**Agile Data Modeling**](http://agiledata.org/essays/agileDataModeling.html).

### How do we track incremental changes?

To keep track of incremental changes in the structure of the dimensional model, it is suitable to use a database change management tool. Some of the best known Open Source tools are [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/), [Liquibase](http://www.liquibase.org/) or [DBDeploy](http://dbdeploy.com/).

### What can I do if I forget my MySQL password?

If you forget your MySQL password or don't know how to change MySQL root password, follow these steps.

#### Windows

Use the installer (that you can find in control panel > uninstall programs) to restore your MySQL installation.

#### Mac

**Option 1**

Open terminal and follow these steps

 - Stop MySQL:

``` 
sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server stop
``` 

  - Restart mysql with the option "skip grants tables":

``` 
sudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables
``` 

  - Update the "root" user password:

``` 
UPDATE USER SET AUTHENTICATION_STRING=password('NewPassword') WHERE user='root'
``` 

 - Flush privileges

``` 
FLUSH PRIVILEGES
``` 

**Option 2**

In this link you will find the steps (for every OS): http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/resetting-permissions.html. 

**Option 3**

Last but not least. If the previous options are not working, you can uninstall MySQL and completely remove it from your Mac:

  - Open a terminal window
  - Write the following instructions (one by one):

```  
sudo rm /usr/local/mysql
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/mysql*
sudo rm -rf /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM
sudo rm -rf /Library/PreferencePanes/My*
sudo rm -rf ~/Library/PreferencePanes/My*
sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/mysql*
sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/MySQL*
sudo rm -rf /private/var/db/receipts/*mysql*
``` 

After this, you need to install again MySQL and keep the auto-generated password. Then:

 - Start the database (from the system preferences).
 - Open MySQL Workbench and create a connection. 
 - It will ask for the generated password. After that a new window will appear to propose a new password. Choose one easy to remember. After this you will be able to enter to the server with your new password.
