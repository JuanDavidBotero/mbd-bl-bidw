## Software Installation

  - **Data Warehouse**: MySQL (database) and MySQL Workbench (database modeling and SQL development)
  - **ETL**: Pentaho Data Integration (PDI)
  - **Business Intelligence/Data Visualization**: Tableau Desktop

### Steps

**Install Java**

  - Download Java JDK v8 from: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html
  - Install and follow the instructions

**Install MySQL**

  - Download the right version of MySQL and MySQL Workbench for your OS 
    - MySQL: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
    - MySQL Workbench: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
  - Install all the programs and follow the instructions:
    - [Windows] During the installation process you will configure the password for root user (choose pentaho2018 o a password that you will remember).
    - [Mac] During the installation process you will configure the password for root user (choose pentaho2018 o a password that you will remember). If you forget the password you will be able to change it from system preferences.
    - PDI and MYSQL Workbench only supports legacy password encription, not the new strong encription available in MySQL 8.

> Note: for Microsoft Windows it is just one installer for MAC, two files.

Remember to start the server to be able to use the database. Open MySQL Workbench and create a new connection using the right user and password and the standard parameters for configuration.

**Install PDI**

We will use the community version of Pentaho Data Integration (a.k.a PDI). It can be downloaded from this [link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pentaho/files/Pentaho%208.0/client-tools/).
